# Back End for ICBS Website

My first MERN Stack. Hosted on Digital Ocean. Website is https//:www.bautistasinai.com
A website for my local church which uses [Editor.js](https://github.com/codex-team/editor.js) to add/display user content.
Build is copy pasted from corresponding [front end](https://github.com/sethvan/ICBS_Front_End). In Digital Ocean Droplet I pull from
here implement changes.
